# portfolio

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

STILL NEED RECENT PHOTO
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

DONE WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
DONE THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

CURRENTLY SPACES ARE BLANK AS I HAVE NO WORK TO SHOW
DONE WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
DONE THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

FIRST BLANK SPACE IS BIGGER BUT NO IMAGES, WHEN I GET SOME WORK UNDER MY BELT I WILL BE ABLE TO POPULATE THESE
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

I DO NOT HAVE ANY APPLICATIONS TO TAKE THE USER TO. THEY CURRENTLY GO TO GOOGLE.COM
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application

DONE WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
DONE THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport


I still need to go back through the code and update it with developer notes. As it is now, it is a very simple layout. I plan on revisiting this frequently to polish it.
